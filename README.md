# basic-image-processing
This project serves as a simple yet illustrative playground for basic image processing operations using Python. It demonstrates how to load, manipulate, and visualize images using popular libraries such as OpenCV and Matplotlib.

# Features:
## 1. Load and Display Original Image:
The function load_and_display_original_image loads an image , converts it from the default BGR format to RGB, and displays it using Matplotlib. The original RGB image is then returned.
## 2. Apply Image Processing Operations:
The function apply_image_processing_operations takes an original RGB image as input and applies various image processing operations. These include darkening, lightening, inverting, adjusting contrast, and converting to grayscale. The processed images are returned as a tuple.
## 3. Display Processed Images:
The function display_processed_images takes a tuple of processed images and displays them in a 2x3 grid using Matplotlib. Titles are assigned to each subplot, and a grayscale colormap is applied to the grayscale image for better visualization.


# Note:
The example uses a sample image ; feel free to replace it with your own image file.
Experiment with additional image processing techniques or customize the code for your specific needs.
This project is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for exploring more advanced image processing concepts. Have fun experimenting with different images and modifications!
